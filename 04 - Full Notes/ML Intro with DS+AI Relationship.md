# ML Intro with DS+AI Relationship


### Big Idea

- Machine learning, and artificial intelligence, are so popular due the concept of the "data economy".
- Fact: "the data economy has increased 44x in the last 11 years".

- Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to intelligence displayed by machines that simulates human and animal intelligence.
	- In general, it refers to machines, or computer programs, that have the capability to sense, reason, and act.
- Data science is used to find patterns in data by using statistical methods.
- Machine learning enables machines to learn without being explicitly programmed, and is thus, a subset of AI.
- Machine learning is a subset of AI, while data science is a field that helps eventually create AI systems.

### Machine Learning Specifics

- It needs to be crystal clear *how* machine learning differs from traditional programming.
- Traditional programming involves providing data and code, evaluating the output, and then deciding if its "good enough" or needs to be re-written.
- Machine learning must also follow the same general process, with the notable exception that the training refines the ML model.
	- After evaluation, instead of changing the code, the model, or data, is tweaked. 

### Machine Learning Applications (Brief Intro)
- Briefly introduce the major applications (these will get their own note eventually).
- Classification:
	- Computer program learns from the data and classifies a new observation
	- Focused on predicting discrete responses and qualitative targets
- Categorization:
	- Organizes data into categories for efficient use
- Clustering:
	- Collection of objects on the basis of similarity and dissimilarity between them
- Trend analysis:
	- Aimed at predicting future data points based on time series data
- Anomaly detection:
	- Seeks to detect an anomaly from the rest of the datapoints
	- Indicates a presence of intended or unintended attacks, faults, and so on
- Visualization:
	- Analytics presented visually to make it easier to understand
- Decision making:
	- Perform decisions based on data; influence decisions based on probability of future outcomes
- Lastly, machine learning is used commonly in the fields of image processing, robotics, data mining, video games, text analysis, and healthcare.
