## Notes

1:14 

- Data economy has increased 44x times in 11 years
- Constant battle over the data, and is projected to continue to grow

2:09

- Artificial Intelligence refers to intelligence displayed by machines that simulates human and animal intelligence
- Sense, reason, and act
- Example: self-driving cars
	- Why? - fulfills the "simulates human intelligence" part of the definition
	- Self-driving cars mimic what humans can do by sensing the surroundings around the car and acting properly
- Example: Siri (iPhone)
	- Why? - listens to your voice commands to perform tasks, so Siri is taking in information from your voice and then performing actions on its own

5:42

- What is the relationship between AI, ML, and Data Science
- All in the same general field, but each has its own specific applications and use cases
	- Important to be well-versed in all these fields
- Data science: converts data into relevant features
	- Data transformation: important for data integration and management
- Goal of using data --> make useful predictions
	- Data straight to features is unsupervised learning, and is a subset under machine learning
	- Data to features can also be accomplished via. transformation, which is a data science technique
		- Would involve domain-specific knowledge to extract features, and may be a long process
		- These features, regardless of how they were derived can be used with supervised learning to generate predictions
	- Deep learning is more powerful since it takes the data straight to predictions
		- It is useful when there is less structure in the data

8:01

- Now that we have predictions of some sort, what can we do with them?
- By using the predictions, an analysis can take place (data science task) - this results in insights
- From there, humans can get involved to tailor the AI's actions, or the predictions can simply be used to make automated decisions

- Important link between AI and Machine Learning
- A vital distinction is that machine learning is where machines learn without being explicitly programmed
- AI is just the engineering of making intelligent machines and programs, therefore, machine learning is naturally a subset of AI

9:40

- Data science is used to find patterns in data by using statistical methods
- Statistical machine learning actually uses the same techniques as data science, essentially, it is just applying statistical methods
- Data science covers techniques like statistical modeling, visualization, and pattern recognition
- Machine Learning focuses on developing algorithms from the data provided

10:16

- The capability of artificial intelligence systems to learn by extracting patterns from data is known as machine learning
- ![[ai_ml_screenshot2.png]]

- From this image, we can see that a key aspect is a focus on improvement; an external system of some kind is present to push the algorithm in the right direction
	- This external system needs to be robust, as the only way the machine learning algorithm improves is from the feedback via. this external system
	- The goal is to have the next prediction be better than the previous one

11:30

- If machine learning is just a computer program, what makes it so special?
- Fundamental difference:
	- Traditional approach: provide code + data to the computer, receive an output
	- Machine learning: provide data + output to the model; the model then optimizes the output
- Traditional approach:
	- Evaluate problem at hand --> create code --> run code and evaluate for errors --> if satisfactory, deploy; else, re-code your program
- Machine learning:
	- Evaluate problem at hand --> create ML model --> train an ML model to find relationship between the inputs and outputs in the provided dataset --> evaluate model --> if results are good enough, deploy, else, repeat training with changes


13:12

- Machine learning has some overarching applications
- Classification:
	- Computer program learns from the data and classifies a new observation
	- Focused on predicting discrete responses and qualitative targets
- Categorization:
	- Organizes data into categories for efficient use
- Clustering:
	- Collection of objects on the basis of similarity and dissimilarity between them
- Trend analysis:
	- Aimed at predicting future data points based on time series data
- Anomaly detection:
	- Seeks to detect an anomaly from the rest of the datapoints
	- Indicates a presence of intended or unintended attacks, faults, and so on
- Visualization:
	- Analytics presented visually to make it easier to understand
- Decision making:
	- Perform decisions based on data; influence decisions based on probability of future outcomes

18:15

- Machine learning used commonly in the following fields: image processing, robotics, data mining, video games, text analysis, healthcare
